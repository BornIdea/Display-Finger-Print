# Display-Finger-Print
1.Since the screen does not have enough point positioning, we will test a formula by which we will multiply the point flow with a protocol that never coincides with any of the proposed.
2.Create a fingerprint scanner application taken from the display directly.
Create a cloud, a medium for uploading a fingerprint file.
Develop fingerprint templates to test the best and safest way to create a file and save it.
Create a virtual machine for each finger added separately so you can have a public browsing environment on your phone and a personal one.
In the future to invent a template that is different from "png", "bmp", "jpg", "jpeg" and so on the file is an incomprehensible type with an incomprehensible algorithm.
